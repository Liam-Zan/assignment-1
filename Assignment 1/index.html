						Although some of the result align with my personal traits, they failed to portray my full personality.

The 16personlities stated that "The strength of conviction bolsters Protagonists' innate leadership skills, particularly their ability to guide people to work together in service of the greater good." Therefore, If I were to take the results into account, I would position myself in a leadership position to guide members to work together.

							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
						</header>
						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p style="text-align:left;">
						Ever since the discovery of the Covid-19 vaccine in 2021, countries across the world begins to lower their travel restrictions as the number of vaccinated citizens increases progressively. Upon which, the tourism and food service industry begins to recover simultaneously.
						<br><br>
						Bearing this in mind, the idea for a restaurant seeking application came to be. The application will act as a bridge between restaurants and customers as it will help strengthen the relationship between them. On top of the standard booking features, the application will also offer additional features such as following the restaurant updates, offers and private complaint to further connect with their customers. 
						<br><br>
						Additionally, the application will also offer social media platform features for interactions between customers. Those features will vary from messaging, posting and following users to filtering users with similar food preferences. 
						<br><br>
						The main goal of social restaurant seeking applications is to assist tourists and foodies who are not familiar with the region; and to help restaurants build a stronger bond with their customers while spending thousands to catch up with their customers.
						<br><br>

							<h2>Motivation</h2>
						</header>
						<p style="text-align:left;">
						In 2021, the global food service industry has an estimated market size of USD $2.52 trillion, indicating that the industry is significantly larger industry. Additionally, the travel tourism industry contributes about USD $9630 Billion to world's GDP in 2019 (Statista, 2020). 
						<br><br>
						Since the restaurant seeking application will mainly target the foodies, tourists and restaurants, The relatively large market will not only help customers to look for restaurants, but also assisting the restaurants in multiple aspects of their business.

							<h2>Description</h2>
						</header>
						<p style="text-align:left;">
							The application will be a mobile phone software that will be available on both android and apple stores. The users will have an option to create an account with their email address to unlock additional features such as the social media platform, commenting, and following other users or the restaurants. Without an account, the user will still be able to access the other restaurant-seeking features, such as the filtering and previewing reviews left by the other users.						
							<br><br>
							The primary revenue of the application is through skippable google ads. The secondary revenue includes the subscription model provided to restaurants to unlock additional features such as the booking for a table.						
						<br><br>
						The social restaurant-seeking application aims to improve interactions between Restaurants & Customers, Customers & Customers, and Tourists & their destinations.

							<h2>Features for Users (customers/ tourists)</h2>
						</header>
						<p style="text-align:left;">
						With the application, the users can choose their desired restaurants using advanced filters such as the restaurant category and following user recommendations. Once the restaurant is picked, the user will then be able to book and review honest reviews given by other users on the restaurant. 
						<br><br>
						Additionally, the application will offer customers additional social media features once they have created an account. Those features include following restaurants, users and channels, Finding users based on their preferred food categories in the area, posting dishes, and previewing stories posted by restaurants. The application will also offer other standard features such as messaging users or restaurants, commenting and sharing restaurants or posts.
						<br><br>
						We can also offer a particular reward for users based on the number of high-quality reviews on restaurants in the area to further encourage them to leave reliable reviews. Our team will evaluate the quality of the reviews to provide them with verified status. The users that wish to leave a high quality will also need to attach the receipt given by the restaurant to assure the evaluation team further.

							<h2>Features for Restaurants</h2>
						</header>
						<p style="text-align:left;">
						For the restaurant to keep the customers up to date, the application will offer services that involve posting stories and regular posts. The restaurant can also release a frequent update on the menu through the application to showcase the updated changes. Offering discounts and coupons to attract more customers. The followers will also be notified once there are changes to menu, posts, and stories						
						<br><br>
						With the use of the application, the restaurant will be able to reduce its expenses in several aspects of its business as we will also be offering features such as following competitors' trends, Booking features, suggestions and tips straight from customers.
						<br><br>
						We can also offer the booking and other features to restaurants in a subscription model to further improve our income. However, I do not recommend this approach as this will inevitably result in customers thinking that the application's main features are locked away behind a paywall. As an alternative, the application can instead use an ads-based income to generate income while offering the full feature of the application to its users.

							<h2>Tools and Technologies </h2>

						<p style="text-align:left;">
							To code this mobile application, we will need a team of software developers that could work with Php, C++, Erlang and JavaScript. If we chose to code it with our own team of developers, we will need all the equipment relating with PC, Wi-Fi, etc.  On the other hand, we could easily hire a mobile software developing company that already has equipment up and running.

							<h2>Skills Required </h2>
						</header>
						<p style="text-align:left;">
						To develop the mobile application, The software developer team can easily be hired by handpicking or we could outsource the software development to a third party company.
						<br>
						Additionally, we will also need a maintenance team to keep the application up and running. Maintenance team should also be relatively easy to find.
 						Moreover, a review evaluation team is needed to evaluate the quality of the restaurant reviews. An evaluation team should be a small team of 5 to 10 members with at least a month of training to maintain the quality of the reviews.
 						As for the hardware, we will need to hire a third-party company such as VentraIP to keep our servers up and running.

						If the project is successful, the application will be used across the global food service industry as a reliable source of review provider for restaurants. The restaurants, customers and tourist alike will have an easier time communicating with one another. As more restaurants join the application, the new restaurants will treat this as an opportunity to showcase their differentiated products on the platform to achieve higher brand recognition. 						<br><br>
						With the use of the application, the restaurant will be able to reduce its expenses in several aspects of its business as we will also be offering features such as following competitors' trends, Booking features, suggestions and tips straight from customers.
